# GtyBluetooth
Build on ZeroFengLee/CmdBluetooth(4.1.1) , add new features like multi-connection ability and write to certain peripheral.

Because CmdBluetooth Don't support multiple connection, which is pretty important to my own project, so I wrote this 'GtyBluetooth'.

The project is still working in progress.
